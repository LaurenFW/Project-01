## Process

When I got the project given to us, I spent about 1-2 days planning my design with a wireframe and pseudo coding in Trello which is an online to-do list so I can track what I needed to do.
I also did the basic of my HTML and CSS to see where things were going on the page (including my grid) and then started with my JavaScript

At the start of the day I looked at my Trello board and would base my day on tasks I need to do, and list them in order of priority. If I encounted a problem I would work on it for about 30 minutes and if I hadn't of solved it I would move on and come back to it later.

My main goal was to get my JavaScript working with a playable game that you could win or lose. I managed to get this completed within the first 4/5 days and that left me time to find bugs and to style my game.

I really enjoyed making Snake my own game by implementing my designs in there, as I was following a snake theme with Harry Potter.
I used programs like google images to get my images and gifs and edited them with ezgif.com.


### Challenges
The biggest challenges for me was a JavaScript problem and was to stop my food from multiplying in the body of the snake, I overcame this problem by making a while loop in JavaScript, this would detect that the square in my grid was already filled with my snake and keep looping around until it found an empty square.

The problem was actually quite simple when I got to the end, I knew I had to do a while loop but implementing it into my code was tough but I managed to break it down and get it working.
Also Flexbox was quite a challenge to get everything where I wanted but I was determined to work through it and try and solve the problems I was faced.

### Wins
The biggest win was getting my CSS to look the way I wanted using gifs and images, I also managed to hide and show images when the game was lost or you switched to the start screen.
I really understand Javascript so much more by using it on a game where all my functions connected with each other.



## Future features
If I came back to review my project, then I definitely would like to add a high score and responsive design.
