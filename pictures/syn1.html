<meta property="og:description" content="In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, we see
the adventures of Harry and his friends’ children. Things get
complicated quickly when the Sorting Hat places Harry’s son Albus
in Slytherin. Every one immediately judges Albus as a
disappointment to his father’s legacy. However, Albus discovers
an unexpected friend in Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco and
Astoria. Scorpius joined Slytherin House like his father, but
rumors persist that Scorpius isn’t actually Draco’s son. They
claim that Scorpius is actually the child of Lord Voldemort.
Albus and Scorpius bond over their strained relationships with
their families. When Harry refuses Amos Diggory’s request to save
his son Cedric with a Time-Turner, Albus and Scorpius take up the
mission instead. Part of Albus' motivation is his resentment, as he
feels that his father won’t do something bold and heroic like
Harry Potter is supposed to. However, Amos’ supposed niece
Delphini isn’t who she claims to be.
Delphini may be the most cursed and pitiable character of all.
She was conceived by Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Both
her parents fell during the Battle of Hogwarts. She sets the main
conflict in motion, scheming to alter time and reunite with her
Dark Lord father. However, several major questions linger about
Voldemort’s long lost daughter. She briefly describes her
background to Albus and Scorpius, but the source of her power, her
cunning instincts, and her motivation are never fully explored in
the play. In the Harry Potter series, there is always more to
uncover.
Here are the 20 Things That Make No Sense About
Voldemort’s Dughter!
20 WHY IS SHE NAMED DELPHINI?


The names of Harry Potter characters totally run the gamut from
mundane to fantastic. Delphini is definitely more on the fantastic
side, but is there any explanation about where that name comes
from?
Delphini may refer to a constellation in the northern sky known
as Delphinus. Delphinus has a main sequence blue-white star in it
called Alpha-Delphini. The Black family is known for naming
children after stars and constellations, including Bellatrix and
Sirius. Since Bellatrix was Delphini’s mother, this seems like
the most logical explanation. In a more creative sense, though,
Delphini may also refer to a legend from Greek Mythology. The
female dragon known as Delphyne guarded the Oracle of Delphi. Gaia,
Delphyne’s mother, ordered her to this task.
19 WHAT EXACTLY DID VOLDEMORT HAVE PLANNED FOR HER?


Voldemort was obsessed with immortality. His campaign of terror
and control were all about his desire to life forever. He designed
his Horcrux scheme to ensure multiple pieces of his soul could each
survive even if his body was destroyed.
The very concept of considering children as part of his plans
for longevity must have been tough for him to swallow. In a certain
sense, it would mean admitting the possibility that he wouldn’t
be around forever. Did Voldemort ever envision Delphi as his heir
and replacement, or did he only ever imagine her as another
servant? Would he have raised her and taught her to be his equal,
or would he keep some knowledge and power safely to himself?
18 WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN HER CAREGIVER IF VOLDEMORT WON?


Voldemort obviously didn’t plan to fall during the Battle of
Hogwarts, and, ideally, the mother of his child would not have
fallen there either. However, we don’t know how much being
around for his daughter weighed on him during the battle.
Assuming he had won and survived, he may have only been interested
in being around for Delphi to ensure that she fulfilled her role as
his servant and heir.
However, even Voldemort’s baby would have still been a baby
for a while. Who was going to look after her, feed her, house her,
and educate her? Perhaps if they won the war, Bellatrix might have
been happy to raise her and Voldemort’s daughter. However, even
during the Battle of Hogwarts, somebody probably had to be watching
little Delphi.
17 WHAT IS HER SURNAME?


Delphi’s surname is never mentioned in Harry Potter and the
Cursed Child. We only ever know her by her first name. She almost
certainly has one, but figuring out what it should be is not
very straight forward. Or rather, figuring out what surname her
parents wanted her to have is a little complicated.
Conventionally, she would have her father’s surname. However,
Tom Riddle gave up his muggle father’s name with extreme disdain.
It seems unlikely Voldemort would pass that singular title onto his
daughter and name her Delphi Voldemort. If they decided to give
Delphi her mother’s family name, she would be Delphi
Lestrange. However, that seems unlikely since Voldemort may have
just thought of Bellatrix as a loyal follower and convenient child
bearer.
16 DID SHE RECEIVE A HOGWARTS LETTER?
In a secluded tower at Hogwarts, there is a faded quill and a
peeling, yellowing book bound in dragon hide. These are the Quill
of Acceptance and the Book of Admittance. Every time a witch or
wizard of sufficient magical capability is born, the Quill and the
Book enter them for admittance to Hogwarts once they turn eleven
years old.
This pair of ancient enchanted items doesn’t miss anyone.
Surely the Quill and the Book recorded Delphi for eventual
enrollment. So why did she never receive a Hogwarts letter? When
Harry turned eleven, the Hogwarts letters literally flooded 4
Privet Drive. Did they not persist like that for Delphi? Did
Euphemia Rowle somehow prevent Delphi’s Hogwarts letters from
arriving? Would her bribe be forfeit if she let Delphi go to
Hogwarts?
15 WHAT ELSE HAPPENED TO HER IN THE TIMELINE WHERE VOLDEMORT WON?


Scorpius and Albus deduce that Delphi was in fact the Augurey,
the authoritarian figure referred to by Dolores Umbridge and Draco
Malfoy. In the timeline in which Voldemort won the war for the
Wizarding World, Delphi grew up to become the head of the Ministry
of Magic.
By the time Delphi came of age, Voldemort would have had much
more time to reshape the Wizarding World in the UK however he
wanted. Delphi would have everything going for her. Her mother and
father would be alive and opposition to their ideals would be
stamped out. Perhaps Delphi would have become even more powerful
than what we saw of her in the original timeline. Instead of being
an outcast, she would have been a prodigy.
14 WHEN EXACTLY WAS BELLATRIX PREGNANT WITH HER?


Delphi must have been born before the Battle of Hogwarts, but
the specific time when Bellatrix was pregnant with her is a bit
vague. Voldemort must have propositioned Bellatrix with a child
sometime after the battle in the Department of Mysteries.
Conceiving and carrying Delphi would help explain why neither
Voldemort nor Bellatrix appeared during the events of Half-Blood
Prince.
Was Voldemort considering having a child before then? If he
wasn't, then perhaps the destruction of the prophesy convinced him
to move forward with this alternative plan to protect Slytherin’s
legacy. Delphi must have been born before the trio were abducted
and taken to Malfoy Manor, since Bellatrix showed no obvious signs
of having been pregnant when she appeared in that sequence.
13 WHY WAS AMOS DIGGORY SINGLED OUT?


Delphi evidently decided that she needed a cover story while she
developed her plan to bring her father back. She posed as a niece
of Amos Diggory and bewitched Amos with a Confundus charm so that
he would go along with her deception.
In Cursed Child, Amos seeks out Harry Potter and begs him to use
a Time-Turner to save his son Cedric’s life. However, how did
Delphi know that “the spare” in the prophesy referred to Cedric
in the first place? She needed some way of getting the Time-Turner
herself, but how did she know Albus and Scorpius would be eager to
help? Did she know all along that humiliating Credirc would create
a timeline where Voldemort won, or did she only realize that
possibility after Albus and Scorpius told her about it?
12 WHY WEREN'T THE ROWLES MORE SUPPORTIVE OF HER?


Voldemort obviously expected to win the Second Wizarding War and
for his influence to grow. This would have made it much safer for
Delphi to grow up in a world where Voldemort was in charge and his
followers controlled the Wizarding World. Regardless, the Rowle
family was known to be pretty devoted Death Eaters. If they
believed in Voldemort’s cause, wouldn’t they have been happy to
help raise Voldemort’s daughter?
Delphi tells Scorpius and Albus that Euphemia Rowle took her in
mostly for the gold that was offered to her. Like most Death Eaters
after Voldemort was defeated, Euphemia probably didn’t want
anything to do with Voldemort or his daughter. However, it seems
odd that the Rowles would turn on Voldemort and still agree to
raise his child.
11 WERE HER MAGICAL TALENTS INHERITED OR LEARNED?


It seems pretty random how magical talent may manifest in young
witches and wizards. Both nature and nurture can play a big part.
Harry’s parents were both very talented in magic,  but Harry
grew up with the Dursleys, who discouraged even mentioning magic.
Similarly, Delphi grew up in an unsupportive home. She at least
knew about magic, but she didn’t know about her true potential as
Voldemort’s heir until Rodolphus found her. Again, this is
similar to Harry, since Hagrid was the one who found him and told
him about his parents.
Did Delphi study and practice on her own to develop her magical
power? Also, did it only begin in earnest after Rodolphus found her
and assisted her, or was she always a natural talent like her
father was before her?
10 HOW CAN SHE CLAIM TO KNOW HARRY BETTER THAN VOLDEMORT DID?


In the confrontation between Harry and Delphi in the past,
Delphi claims to know Harry better than Voldemort ever did. At
best, this could only be a taunt to throw Harry off even more. It
seems very unlikely that the claim can actually be true.
Voldemort and Harry shared a multifaceted magical link. Harry
became an unintentional Horcrux when Voldemort attacked him as an
infant, and, later, Voldemort used Harry’s blood to restore his
corporeal body. Over the course of their confrontations, Voldemort
also successfully tricked Harry into thinking Sirius was held
captive in the Department of Mysteries. Delphi never had access to
Harry Potter like that. The only way that boast would carry weight
is if Delphi had supposedly learned from her father’s mistakes in
fighting Harry.
9 HOW DID SHE SNEAK INTO HOGWARTS IN THE FIRST ALTERNATE TIMELINE?


When Albus and Scorpius traveled back in time the first time,
they didn’t reshape events like they wanted. They didn’t save
Cedric’s life and their own lives and families were altered in
disappointing ways. Ron and Hermione never married or had children,
and Albus was sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin,
separating Albus and Scorpius.
Albus sends Delphi an owl letting her know that they failed and
Delphi sneaks into Hogwarts to convince Scorpius and Albus to
reconcile. However, i's never explained how this is
possible. What's even more confusing is the fact
that Delphi even remarks on how lax Hogwarts' security
seems. However, she never actually tells Albus exactly how she got
into the school without getting caught.
8 WHY WOULD SHE PREFER PASSING AWAY OR AMNESIA?


When Delphi, Albus, Scorpius, and Harry and his adult friends
travel back in time to October 1981, they stop Delphi from changing
the future. She had planned to prevent Voldemort from encountering
Harry as a baby, thereby ensuring that he would never be defeated
in the first place. All of her deceptive and malicious efforts were
meant to reunite her with her father.
When Albus, Scorpius, and their families defeat her, she begs
them to take her life or at least wipe her memory of her family
and her identity. However, it's unclear why she would wish this.
Was her relationship with her absent father so important to her
that this failure was intolerable for her? If she were imprisoned,
there would at least  still be the possibility of escaping and
continuing to serve his legacy.
7 IS SHE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN?


Plenty of Voldemort's followers were sentenced to terms in
Azkaban. Even some wizards and witches who were wrongly convicted
of crimes connected to Lord Voldemort’s service endured
incarceration in the prison.
Sirius Black managed to escapd Azkaban on his own, without any
outside help. His conviction in his innocence let him fool the
Dementors and slip away. The only time other genuine followers of
Voldemort escaped from Azkaban was when the Dementors deserted
their posts and joined him. After 1998, the Ministry of Magic
stopped employing Dementors as guards. So when Delphi was
imprisoned, Aurors would stand guard instead. Even with the
Dementors gone, the magical safeguards against escaping prisoners
must be considerable. Voldemort never had to escape from Azkaban,
so we don’t know if Voldemort’s daughter is capable of doing it
or not.
6 WHY DOES SHE HAVE A TATTOO OF HER AUGUREY?


Delphi was sent to live with Euphemia Rowle, who became her
foster mother. Rowle kept an Augurey as a pet. The Augurey is a
magical bird that supposedly wails whenever a passerby should be
wary of an unfortunate fate, though the more informed consensus on
the creature claims that Augureys wail when rain is imminent.
Either way, it doesn’t make much sense as to why Delphi would
get an Augurey tattoo. This bird was a reminder of her childhood
guardian and how much she disliked Delphini. Perhaps instead of
being an omen of downfall, Delphi fashioned it into a symbol of her
authority. The Augurey was her alias in the timeline where
Voldemort won the war, but it's never explained why.
5 DID VOLDEMORT PLAN ON HAVING ANY OTHER HEIRS?
Historical, real life royal families always made sure to produce
multiple children when possible. Multiple children was the best way
to increase the chances of the family enduring. As much as
Voldemort’s pure-blood mania ties in with tradition, it’s
likely Voldemort considered siring multiple heirs. He made multiple
Horcruxes as part of that plan to achieve immortality, so why not
produce multiple children to continue Slytherin’s bloodline as
well?
Perhaps Voldemort would have produced multiple heirs in the
timeline in which he won the war, but we don’t learn anything
definitive to that end. Voldemort might have imagined that multiple
heirs would compete with and threaten to destroy each other, or
him.
4 DOES SHE HAVE ANY HALF SIBLINGS?


As far as we know, Voldemort never had any other children of his
own. However, Bellatrix, the mother of Delphini, was also married.
Rodolphus Lestrange and Bellatrix Black were married shortly after
they both graduated from Hogwarts.
Rodolphus and Bellatrix were among the only Death Eaters to stay
faithful to Voldemort after the infant Harry Potter defeated him.
They may have shared a passion for pure-blood ideology and serving
Voldemort, but there is nothing to indicate any passion or romantic
interest between them. Their two families arranged their marriage,
so it seems like their sense of duty never compelled them to
produce legitimate children. However, this is never confirmed.
3 HOW DID RODOLPHUS TELL HER ABOUT HER HERITAGE?


Rodolphus survived the Battle of Hogwarts, unlike his wife and
his master. The reformed Ministry of Magic sentenced Rodolphus to
imprisonment in Azkaban again for his crimes. We'd expect the
Ministry to ensure that Rodolphus never escaped again, especially
since he was originally sentenced to life in prison for using the
Cruciatus curse on the Longbottoms.
Whether he escaped again or if he was in fact released is not
certain. If he had actually escaped again, you might expect the
Ministry to lead a manhunt for him, like they did with Sirius
Black. However, somehow Rodolphus managed to find the natural
daughter of his wife Bellatrix and Lord Voldemort, since Delphi
learned the truth of her heritage from Rodolphus.
2 DID SHE EVER ASPIRE TO BECOME A DARK RULER HERSELF?


Above all else, Delphi wanted to meet her father. She wanted to
be with him and prove herself to him. However, what did she
imagine for the two of them after that? If she succeeded in
changing history so that they could be together, would their
relationship still turn out like she imagined?
If Harry Potter never became destined to defeat Voldemort, would
Voldemort still eventually win the Wizarding War? Would Delphi have
still grown into her father’s right hand agent? Would she have
been happy in that role forever? Could their relationship have
grown any deeper or healthier than Voldemort’s relationship with
his other servants? Would Delphi only consider becoming a dark
ruler in her own right if her father was defeated, or would she
ever consider overthrowing him?
1 HOW DID SHE BECOME SO CHARMING?


Delphi used magic to trick Amos Diggory into believing she was
his niece. However, other than that, she played a pretty
convincing part. Harry, Albus, and Scorpius all trusted Delphi
immediately. Delphi endeared herself to both Albus and Scorpius
with just the right amount of shyness and righteousness.
However, how did she learn to be so good at manipulating
people? Voldemort had a lot of practice putting on faces to
manipulate people at his orphanage, at Hogwarts, and in the wider
Wizarding World. Delphi never had that experience. She presumably
stayed cooped up with Euphemia Rowle until Rodolphus found her. Did
she simply inherit her nefarious people skills from her father?

travel back in time to October 1981, they stop Delphi from changing
the future. She had planned to prevent Voldemort from encountering
Harry as a baby, thereby ensuring that he would never be defeated
in the first place. All of her deceptive and malicious efforts were
meant to reunite her with her father.
When Albus, Scorpius, and their families defeat her, she begs
them to take her life or at least wipe her memory of her family
and her identity. However, it's unclear why she would wish this.
Was her relationship with her absent father so important to her
that this failure was intolerable for her? If she were imprisoned,
there would at least  still be the possibility of escaping and
continuing to serve his legacy.
7 IS SHE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN?


Plenty of Voldemort's followers were sentenced to terms in
Azkaban. Even some wizards and witches who were wrongly convicted
of crimes connected to Lord Voldemort’s service endured
incarceration in the prison.
Sirius Black managed to escapd Azkaban on his own, without any
outside help. His conviction in his innocence let him fool the
Dementors and slip away. The only time other genuine followers of
Voldemort escaped from Azkaban was when the Dementors deserted
their posts and joined him. After 1998, the Ministry of Magic
stopped employing Dementors as guards. So when Delphi was
imprisoned, Aurors would stand guard instead. Even with the
Dementors gone, the magical safeguards against escaping prisoners
must be considerable. Voldemort never had to escape from Azkaban,
so we don’t know if Voldemort’s daughter is capable of doing it
or not.
6 WHY DOES SHE HAVE A TATTOO OF HER AUGUREY?


Delphi was sent to live with Euphemia Rowle, who became her
foster mother. Rowle kept an Augurey as a pet. The Augurey is a
magical bird that supposedly wails whenever a passerby should be
wary of an unfortunate fate, though the more informed consensus on
the creature claims that Augureys wail when rain is imminent.
Either way, it doesn’t make much sense as to why Delphi would
get an Augurey tattoo. This bird was a reminder of her childhood
guardian and how much she disliked Delphini. Perhaps instead of
being an omen of downfall, Delphi fashioned it into a symbol of her
authority. The Augurey was her alias in the timeline where
Voldemort won the war, but it's never explained why.
5 DID VOLDEMORT PLAN ON HAVING ANY OTHER HEIRS?
Historical, real life royal families always made sure to produce
multiple children when possible. Multiple children was the best way
to increase the chances of the family enduring. As much as
Voldemort’s pure-blood mania ties in with tradition, it’s
likely Voldemort considered siring multiple heirs. He made multiple
Horcruxes as part of that plan to achieve immortality, so why not
produce multiple children to continue Slytherin’s bloodline as
well?
Perhaps Voldemort would have produced multiple heirs in the
timeline in which he won the war, but we don’t learn anything
definitive to that end. Voldemort might have imagined that multiple
heirs would compete with and threaten to destroy each other, or
him.
4 DOES SHE HAVE ANY HALF SIBLINGS?


As far as we know, Voldemort never had any other children of his
own. However, Bellatrix, the mother of Delphini, was also married.
Rodolphus Lestrange and Bellatrix Black were married shortly after
they both graduated from Hogwarts.
Rodolphus and Bellatrix were among the only Death Eaters to stay
faithful to Voldemort after the infant Harry Potter defeated him.
They may have shared a passion for pure-blood ideology and serving
Voldemort, but there is nothing to indicate any passion or romantic
interest between them. Their two families arranged their marriage,
so it seems like their sense of duty never compelled them to
produce legitimate children. However, this is never confirmed.
3 HOW DID RODOLPHUS TELL HER ABOUT HER HERITAGE?


Rodolphus survived the Battle of Hogwarts, unlike his wife and
his master. The reformed Ministry of Magic sentenced Rodolphus to
imprisonment in Azkaban again for his crimes. We'd expect the
Ministry to ensure that Rodolphus never escaped again, especially
since he was originally sentenced to life in prison for using the
Cruciatus curse on the Longbottoms.
Whether he escaped again or if he was in fact released is not
certain. If he had actually escaped again, you might expect the
Ministry to lead a manhunt for him, like they did with Sirius
Black. However, somehow Rodolphus managed to find the natural
daughter of his wife Bellatrix and Lord Voldemort, since Delphi
learned the truth of her heritage from Rodolphus.
2 DID SHE EVER ASPIRE TO BECOME A DARK RULER HERSELF?


Above all else, Delphi wanted to meet her father. She wanted to
be with him and prove herself to him. However, what did she
imagine for the two of them after that? If she succeeded in
changing history so that they could be together, would their
relationship still turn out like she imagined?
If Harry Potter never became destined to defeat Voldemort, would
Voldemort still eventually win the Wizarding War? Would Delphi have
still grown into her father’s right hand agent? Would she have
been happy in that role forever? Could their relationship have
grown any deeper or healthier than Voldemort’s relationship with
his other servants? Would Delphi only consider becoming a dark
ruler in her own right if her father was defeated, or would she
ever consider overthrowing him?
1 HOW DID SHE BECOME SO CHARMING?


Delphi used magic to trick Amos Diggory into believing she was
his niece. However, other than that, she played a pretty
convincing part. Harry, Albus, and Scorpius all trusted Delphi
immediately. Delphi endeared herself to both Albus and Scorpius
with just the right amount of shyness and righteousness.
However, how did she learn to be so good at manipulating
people? Voldemort had a lot of practice putting on faces to
manipulate people at his orphanage, at Hogwarts, and in the wider
Wizarding World. Delphi never had that experience. She presumably
stayed cooped up with Euphemia Rowle until Rodolphus found her. Did
she simply inherit her nefarious people skills from her father?

Potter that make no sense? Let us know in the

  <img src="https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Delphini-Riddle-2-1.jpg"><p>In <strong>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</strong>, we see
the adventures of Harry and his friends’ children. Things get
complicated quickly when the Sorting Hat places Harry’s son Albus
in Slytherin. Every one immediately judges Albus as a
disappointment to his father’s legacy. However, Albus discovers
an unexpected friend in Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco and
Astoria. Scorpius joined Slytherin House like his father, but
rumors persist that Scorpius isn’t actually Draco’s son. They
claim that Scorpius is actually the child of Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>Albus and Scorpius bond over their strained relationships with
their families. When Harry refuses Amos Diggory’s request to save
his son Cedric with a Time-Turner, Albus and Scorpius take up the
mission instead. Part of Albus' motivation is his resentment, as he
feels that his father won’t do something bold and heroic like
Harry Potter is supposed to. However, Amos’ supposed niece
Delphini isn’t who she claims to be.</p>
<p>Delphini may be the most cursed and pitiable character of all.
She was conceived by Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Both
her parents fell during the Battle of Hogwarts. She sets the main
conflict in motion, scheming to alter time and reunite with her
Dark Lord father. However, several major questions linger about
Voldemort’s long lost daughter. She briefly describes her
background to Albus and Scorpius, but the source of her power, her
cunning instincts, and her motivation are never fully explored in
the play. In the Harry Potter series, there is always more to
uncover.</p>
<p>Here are the <strong>20 Things That Make No Sense About
Voldemort’s Dughter</strong>!</p>
20 WHY IS SHE NAMED DELPHINI?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Harry-Potter-Delphini.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>The names of Harry Potter characters totally run the gamut from
mundane to fantastic. Delphini is definitely more on the fantastic
side, but is there any explanation about where that name comes
from?</p>
<p>Delphini may refer to a constellation in the northern sky known
as Delphinus. Delphinus has a main sequence blue-white star in it
called Alpha-Delphini. The Black family is known for naming
children after stars and constellations, including Bellatrix and
Sirius. Since Bellatrix was Delphini’s mother, this seems like
the most logical explanation. In a more creative sense, though,
Delphini may also refer to a legend from Greek Mythology. The
female dragon known as Delphyne guarded the Oracle of Delphi. Gaia,
Delphyne’s mother, ordered her to this task.</p>
19 WHAT EXACTLY DID VOLDEMORT HAVE PLANNED FOR HER?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Death-Eaters.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Voldemort was obsessed with immortality. His campaign of terror
and control were all about his desire to life forever. He designed
his Horcrux scheme to ensure multiple pieces of his soul could each
survive even if his body was destroyed.</p>
<p>The very concept of considering children as part of his plans
for longevity must have been tough for him to swallow. In a certain
sense, it would mean admitting the possibility that he wouldn’t
be around forever. Did Voldemort ever envision Delphi as his heir
and replacement, or did he only ever imagine her as another
servant? Would he have raised her and taught her to be his equal,
or would he keep some knowledge and power safely to himself?</p>
18 WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN HER CAREGIVER IF VOLDEMORT WON?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bellatrix-Lestrange-Harry-Potter.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Voldemort obviously didn’t plan to fall during the Battle of
Hogwarts, and, ideally, the mother of his child would not have
fallen there either. However, we don’t know how much being
around for his daughter weighed on him during the battle.
Assuming he had won and survived, he may have only been interested
in being around for Delphi to ensure that she fulfilled her role as
his servant and heir.</p>
<p>However, even Voldemort’s baby would have still been a baby
for a while. Who was going to look after her, feed her, house her,
and educate her? Perhaps if they won the war, Bellatrix might have
been happy to raise her and Voldemort’s daughter. However, even
during the Battle of Hogwarts, somebody probably had to be watching
little Delphi.</p>
17 WHAT IS HER SURNAME?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Horcrux-Lord-Voldemort-Tom-Riddle.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Delphi’s surname is never mentioned in Harry Potter and the
Cursed Child. We only ever know her by her first name. She almost
certainly has one, but figuring out what it should be is not
very straight forward. Or rather, figuring out what surname her
parents wanted her to have is a little complicated.</p>
<p>Conventionally, she would have her father’s surname. However,
Tom Riddle gave up his muggle father’s name with extreme disdain.
It seems unlikely Voldemort would pass that singular title onto his
daughter and name her Delphi Voldemort. If they decided to give
Delphi her mother’s family name, she would be Delphi
Lestrange. However, that seems unlikely since Voldemort may have
just thought of Bellatrix as a loyal follower and convenient child
bearer.</p>
16 DID SHE RECEIVE A HOGWARTS LETTER?
<p>In a secluded tower at Hogwarts, there is a faded quill and a
peeling, yellowing book bound in dragon hide. These are the Quill
of Acceptance and the Book of Admittance. Every time a witch or
wizard of sufficient magical capability is born, the Quill and the
Book enter them for admittance to Hogwarts once they turn eleven
years old.</p>
<p>This pair of ancient enchanted items doesn’t miss anyone.
Surely the Quill and the Book recorded Delphi for eventual
enrollment. So why did she never receive a Hogwarts letter? When
Harry turned eleven, the Hogwarts letters literally flooded 4
Privet Drive. Did they not persist like that for Delphi? Did
Euphemia Rowle somehow prevent Delphi’s Hogwarts letters from
arriving? Would her bribe be forfeit if she let Delphi go to
Hogwarts?</p>
15 WHAT ELSE HAPPENED TO HER IN THE TIMELINE WHERE VOLDEMORT WON?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Harry-Potter-Voldemort.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Scorpius and Albus deduce that Delphi was in fact the Augurey,
the authoritarian figure referred to by Dolores Umbridge and Draco
Malfoy. In the timeline in which Voldemort won the war for the
Wizarding World, Delphi grew up to become the head of the Ministry
of Magic.</p>
<p>By the time Delphi came of age, Voldemort would have had much
more time to reshape the Wizarding World in the UK however he
wanted. Delphi would have everything going for her. Her mother and
father would be alive and opposition to their ideals would be
stamped out. Perhaps Delphi would have become even more powerful
than what we saw of her in the original timeline. Instead of being
an outcast, she would have been a prodigy.</p>
14 WHEN EXACTLY WAS BELLATRIX PREGNANT WITH HER?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bellatrix-Lestrange-in-Harry-Potter.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Delphi must have been born before the Battle of Hogwarts, but
the specific time when Bellatrix was pregnant with her is a bit
vague. Voldemort must have propositioned Bellatrix with a child
sometime after the battle in the Department of Mysteries.
Conceiving and carrying Delphi would help explain why neither
Voldemort nor Bellatrix appeared during the events of Half-Blood
Prince.</p>
<p>Was Voldemort considering having a child before then? If he
wasn't, then perhaps the destruction of the prophesy convinced him
to move forward with this alternative plan to protect Slytherin’s
legacy. Delphi must have been born before the trio were abducted
and taken to Malfoy Manor, since Bellatrix showed no obvious signs
of having been pregnant when she appeared in that sequence.</p>
13 WHY WAS AMOS DIGGORY SINGLED OUT?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cedric-Diggory-in-Harry-Potter.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Delphi evidently decided that she needed a cover story while she
developed her plan to bring her father back. She posed as a niece
of Amos Diggory and bewitched Amos with a Confundus charm so that
he would go along with her deception.</p>
<p>In Cursed Child, Amos seeks out Harry Potter and begs him to use
a Time-Turner to save his son Cedric’s life. However, how did
Delphi know that “the spare” in the prophesy referred to Cedric
in the first place? She needed some way of getting the Time-Turner
herself, but how did she know Albus and Scorpius would be eager to
help? Did she know all along that humiliating Credirc would create
a timeline where Voldemort won, or did she only realize that
possibility after Albus and Scorpius told her about it?</p>
12 WHY WEREN'T THE ROWLES MORE SUPPORTIVE OF HER?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-potter-cursed-child-book-sales.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Voldemort obviously expected to win the Second Wizarding War and
for his influence to grow. This would have made it much safer for
Delphi to grow up in a world where Voldemort was in charge and his
followers controlled the Wizarding World. Regardless, the Rowle
family was known to be pretty devoted Death Eaters. If they
believed in Voldemort’s cause, wouldn’t they have been happy to
help raise Voldemort’s daughter?</p>
<p>Delphi tells Scorpius and Albus that Euphemia Rowle took her in
mostly for the gold that was offered to her. Like most Death Eaters
after Voldemort was defeated, Euphemia probably didn’t want
anything to do with Voldemort or his daughter. However, it seems
odd that the Rowles would turn on Voldemort and still agree to
raise his child.</p>
11 WERE HER MAGICAL TALENTS INHERITED OR LEARNED?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-Tom-Riddle-Voldemort-Orphanage.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>It seems pretty random how magical talent may manifest in young
witches and wizards. Both nature and nurture can play a big part.
Harry’s parents were both very talented in magic,  but Harry
grew up with the Dursleys, who discouraged even mentioning magic.
Similarly, Delphi grew up in an unsupportive home. She at least
knew about magic, but she didn’t know about her true potential as
Voldemort’s heir until Rodolphus found her. Again, this is
similar to Harry, since Hagrid was the one who found him and told
him about his parents.</p>
<p>Did Delphi study and practice on her own to develop her magical
power? Also, did it only begin in earnest after Rodolphus found her
and assisted her, or was she always a natural talent like her
father was before her?</p>
10 HOW CAN SHE CLAIM TO KNOW HARRY BETTER THAN VOLDEMORT DID?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Harry-Potter-and-Voldemort.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>In the confrontation between Harry and Delphi in the past,
Delphi claims to know Harry better than Voldemort ever did. At
best, this could only be a taunt to throw Harry off even more. It
seems very unlikely that the claim can actually be true.</p>
<p>Voldemort and Harry shared a multifaceted magical link. Harry
became an unintentional Horcrux when Voldemort attacked him as an
infant, and, later, Voldemort used Harry’s blood to restore his
corporeal body. Over the course of their confrontations, Voldemort
also successfully tricked Harry into thinking Sirius was held
captive in the Department of Mysteries. Delphi never had access to
Harry Potter like that. The only way that boast would carry weight
is if Delphi had supposedly learned from her father’s mistakes in
fighting Harry.</p>
9 HOW DID SHE SNEAK INTO HOGWARTS IN THE FIRST ALTERNATE TIMELINE?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hp-timeline-4.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>When Albus and Scorpius traveled back in time the first time,
they didn’t reshape events like they wanted. They didn’t save
Cedric’s life and their own lives and families were altered in
disappointing ways. Ron and Hermione never married or had children,
and Albus was sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin,
separating Albus and Scorpius.</p>
<p>Albus sends Delphi an owl letting her know that they failed and
Delphi sneaks into Hogwarts to convince Scorpius and Albus to
reconcile. However, i's never explained how this is
possible. What's even more confusing is the fact
that Delphi even remarks on how lax Hogwarts' security
seems. However, she never actually tells Albus exactly how she got
into the school without getting caught.</p>
8 WHY WOULD SHE PREFER PASSING AWAY OR AMNESIA?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hermione-granger-memory-charm.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>When Delphi, Albus, Scorpius, and Harry and his adult friends
travel back in time to October 1981, they stop Delphi from changing
the future. She had planned to prevent Voldemort from encountering
Harry as a baby, thereby ensuring that he would never be defeated
in the first place. All of her deceptive and malicious efforts were
meant to reunite her with her father.</p>
<p>When Albus, Scorpius, and their families defeat her, she begs
them to take her life or at least wipe her memory of her family
and her identity. However, it's unclear why she would wish this.
Was her relationship with her absent father so important to her
that this failure was intolerable for her? If she were imprisoned,
there would at least  still be the possibility of escaping and
continuing to serve his legacy.</p>
7 IS SHE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Harry-Potter-azkaban.png">
</a></p>
<p>Plenty of Voldemort's followers were sentenced to terms in
Azkaban. Even some wizards and witches who were wrongly convicted
of crimes connected to Lord Voldemort’s service endured
incarceration in the prison.</p>
<p>Sirius Black managed to escapd Azkaban on his own, without any
outside help. His conviction in his innocence let him fool the
Dementors and slip away. The only time other genuine followers of
Voldemort escaped from Azkaban was when the Dementors deserted
their posts and joined him. After 1998, the Ministry of Magic
stopped employing Dementors as guards. So when Delphi was
imprisoned, Aurors would stand guard instead. Even with the
Dementors gone, the magical safeguards against escaping prisoners
must be considerable. Voldemort never had to escape from Azkaban,
so we don’t know if Voldemort’s daughter is capable of doing it
or not.</p>
6 WHY DOES SHE HAVE A TATTOO OF HER AUGUREY?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Harry-Potter-Augurey.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Delphi was sent to live with Euphemia Rowle, who became her
foster mother. Rowle kept an Augurey as a pet. The Augurey is a
magical bird that supposedly wails whenever a passerby should be
wary of an unfortunate fate, though the more informed consensus on
the creature claims that Augureys wail when rain is imminent.</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn’t make much sense as to why Delphi would
get an Augurey tattoo. This bird was a reminder of her childhood
guardian and how much she disliked Delphini. Perhaps instead of
being an omen of downfall, Delphi fashioned it into a symbol of her
authority. The Augurey was her alias in the timeline where
Voldemort won the war, but it's never explained why.</p>
5 DID VOLDEMORT PLAN ON HAVING ANY OTHER HEIRS?
<p>Historical, real life royal families always made sure to produce
multiple children when possible. Multiple children was the best way
to increase the chances of the family enduring. As much as
Voldemort’s pure-blood mania ties in with tradition, it’s
likely Voldemort considered siring multiple heirs. He made multiple
Horcruxes as part of that plan to achieve immortality, so why not
produce multiple children to continue Slytherin’s bloodline as
well?</p>
<p>Perhaps Voldemort would have produced multiple heirs in the
timeline in which he won the war, but we don’t learn anything
definitive to that end. Voldemort might have imagined that multiple
heirs would compete with and threaten to destroy each other, or
him.</p>
4 DOES SHE HAVE ANY HALF SIBLINGS?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bellatrix-Lestrange-Marriage.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>As far as we know, Voldemort never had any other children of his
own. However, Bellatrix, the mother of Delphini, was also married.
Rodolphus Lestrange and Bellatrix Black were married shortly after
they both graduated from Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Rodolphus and Bellatrix were among the only Death Eaters to stay
faithful to Voldemort after the infant Harry Potter defeated him.
They may have shared a passion for pure-blood ideology and serving
Voldemort, but there is nothing to indicate any passion or romantic
interest between them. Their two families arranged their marriage,
so it seems like their sense of duty never compelled them to
produce legitimate children. However, this is never confirmed.</p>
3 HOW DID RODOLPHUS TELL HER ABOUT HER HERITAGE?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Rodolphus-Lestrange-on-Pottermore.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Rodolphus survived the Battle of Hogwarts, unlike his wife and
his master. The reformed Ministry of Magic sentenced Rodolphus to
imprisonment in Azkaban again for his crimes. We'd expect the
Ministry to ensure that Rodolphus never escaped again, especially
since he was originally sentenced to life in prison for using the
Cruciatus curse on the Longbottoms.</p>
<p>Whether he escaped again or if he was in fact released is not
certain. If he had actually escaped again, you might expect the
Ministry to lead a manhunt for him, like they did with Sirius
Black. However, somehow Rodolphus managed to find the natural
daughter of his wife Bellatrix and Lord Voldemort, since Delphi
learned the truth of her heritage from Rodolphus.</p>
2 DID SHE EVER ASPIRE TO BECOME A DARK RULER HERSELF?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Delphini-Riddle-2-1.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Above all else, Delphi wanted to meet her father. She wanted to
be with him and prove herself to him. However, what did she
imagine for the two of them after that? If she succeeded in
changing history so that they could be together, would their
relationship still turn out like she imagined?</p>
<p>If Harry Potter never became destined to defeat Voldemort, would
Voldemort still eventually win the Wizarding War? Would Delphi have
still grown into her father’s right hand agent? Would she have
been happy in that role forever? Could their relationship have
grown any deeper or healthier than Voldemort’s relationship with
his other servants? Would Delphi only consider becoming a dark
ruler in her own right if her father was defeated, or would she
ever consider overthrowing him?</p>
1 HOW DID SHE BECOME SO CHARMING?
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Harry-Potter-young-Tom-Riddle-Voldemort.png">
</a></p>
<p>Delphi used magic to trick Amos Diggory into believing she was
his niece. However, other than that, she played a pretty
convincing part. Harry, Albus, and Scorpius all trusted Delphi
immediately. Delphi endeared herself to both Albus and Scorpius
with just the right amount of shyness and righteousness.</p>
<p>However, how did she learn to be so good at manipulating
people? Voldemort had a lot of practice putting on faces to
manipulate people at his orphanage, at Hogwarts, and in the wider
Wizarding World. Delphi never had that experience. She presumably
stayed cooped up with Euphemia Rowle until Rodolphus found her. Did
she simply inherit her nefarious people skills from her father?</p>

Potter </strong>that make no sense? Let us know in the

the adventures of Harry and his friends’ children. Things get
complicated quickly when the Sorting Hat places Harry’s son Albus
in Slytherin. Every one immediately judges Albus as a
disappointment to his father’s legacy. However, Albus discovers
an unexpected friend in Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco and
Astoria. Scorpius joined Slytherin House like his father, but
rumors persist that Scorpius isn’t actually Draco’s son. They
claim that Scorpius is actually the child of Lord Voldemort.
Albus and Scorpius bond over their strained relationships with
their families. When Harry refuses Amos Diggory’s request to save
his son Cedric with a Time-Turner, Albus and Scorpius take up the
mission instead. Part of Albus' motivation is his resentment, as he
feels that his father won’t do something bold and heroic like
Harry Potter is supposed to. However, Amos’ supposed niece
Delphini isn’t who she claims to be.
Delphini may be the most cursed and pitiable character of all.
She was conceived by Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Both
her parents fell during the Battle of Hogwarts. She sets the main
conflict in motion, scheming to alter time and reunite with her
Dark Lord father. However, several major questions linger about
Voldemort’s long lost daughter. She briefly describes her
background to Albus and Scorpius, but the source of her power, her
cunning instincts, and her motivation are never fully explored in
the play. In the Harry Potter series, there is always more to
uncover.
Here are the 20 Things That Make No Sense About
Voldemort’s Dughter!
20 WHY IS SHE NAMED DELPHINI?


The names of Harry Potter characters totally run the gamut from
mundane to fantastic. Delphini is definitely more on the fantastic
side, but is there any explanation about where that name comes
from?
Delphini may refer to a constellation in the northern sky known
as Delphinus. Delphinus has a main sequence blue-white star in it
called Alpha-Delphini. The Black family is known for naming
children after stars and constellations, including Bellatrix and
Sirius. Since Bellatrix was Delphini’s mother, this seems like
the most logical explanation. In a more creative sense, though,
Delphini may also refer to a legend from Greek Mythology. The
female dragon known as Delphyne guarded the Oracle of Delphi. Gaia,
Delphyne’s mother, ordered her to this task.
19 WHAT EXACTLY DID VOLDEMORT HAVE PLANNED FOR HER?


Voldemort was obsessed with immortality. His campaign of terror
and control were all about his desire to life forever. He designed
his Horcrux scheme to ensure multiple pieces of his soul could each
survive even if his body was destroyed.
The very concept of considering children as part of his plans
for longevity must have been tough for him to swallow. In a certain
sense, it would mean admitting the possibility that he wouldn’t
be around forever. Did Voldemort ever envision Delphi as his heir
and replacement, or did he only ever imagine her as another
servant? Would he have raised her and taught her to be his equal,
or would he keep some knowledge and power safely to himself?
18 WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN HER CAREGIVER IF VOLDEMORT WON?


Voldemort obviously didn’t plan to fall during the Battle of
Hogwarts, and, ideally, the mother of his child would not have
fallen there either. However, we don’t know how much being
around for his daughter weighed on him during the battle.
Assuming he had won and survived, he may have only been interested
in being around for Delphi to ensure that she fulfilled her role as
his servant and heir.
However, even Voldemort’s baby would have still been a baby
for a while. Who was going to look after her, feed her, house her,
and educate her? Perhaps if they won the war, Bellatrix might have
been happy to raise her and Voldemort’s daughter. However, even
during the Battle of Hogwarts, somebody probably had to be watching
little Delphi.
17 WHAT IS HER SURNAME?


Delphi’s surname is never mentioned in Harry Potter and the
Cursed Child. We only ever know her by her first name. She almost
certainly has one, but figuring out what it should be is not
very straight forward. Or rather, figuring out what surname her
parents wanted her to have is a little complicated.
Conventionally, she would have her father’s surname. However,
Tom Riddle gave up his muggle father’s name with extreme disdain.
It seems unlikely Voldemort would pass that singular title onto his
daughter and name her Delphi Voldemort. If they decided to give
Delphi her mother’s family name, she would be Delphi
Lestrange. However, that seems unlikely since Voldemort may have
just thought of Bellatrix as a loyal follower and convenient child
bearer.
16 DID SHE RECEIVE A HOGWARTS LETTER?
In a secluded tower at Hogwarts, there is a faded quill and a
peeling, yellowing book bound in dragon hide. These are the Quill
of Acceptance and the Book of Admittance. Every time a witch or
wizard of sufficient magical capability is born, the Quill and the
Book enter them for admittance to Hogwarts once they turn eleven
years old.
This pair of ancient enchanted items doesn’t miss anyone.
Surely the Quill and the Book recorded Delphi for eventual
enrollment. So why did she never receive a Hogwarts letter? When
Harry turned eleven, the Hogwarts letters literally flooded 4
Privet Drive. Did they not persist like that for Delphi? Did
Euphemia Rowle somehow prevent Delphi’s Hogwarts letters from
arriving? Would her bribe be forfeit if she let Delphi go to
Hogwarts?
15 WHAT ELSE HAPPENED TO HER IN THE TIMELINE WHERE VOLDEMORT WON?


Scorpius and Albus deduce that Delphi was in fact the Augurey,
the authoritarian figure referred to by Dolores Umbridge and Draco
Malfoy. In the timeline in which Voldemort won the war for the
Wizarding World, Delphi grew up to become the head of the Ministry
of Magic.
By the time Delphi came of age, Voldemort would have had much
more time to reshape the Wizarding World in the UK however he
wanted. Delphi would have everything going for her. Her mother and
father would be alive and opposition to their ideals would be
stamped out. Perhaps Delphi would have become even more powerful
than what we saw of her in the original timeline. Instead of being
an outcast, she would have been a prodigy.
14 WHEN EXACTLY WAS BELLATRIX PREGNANT WITH HER?


Delphi must have been born before the Battle of Hogwarts, but
the specific time when Bellatrix was pregnant with her is a bit
vague. Voldemort must have propositioned Bellatrix with a child
sometime after the battle in the Department of Mysteries.
Conceiving and carrying Delphi would help explain why neither
Voldemort nor Bellatrix appeared during the events of Half-Blood
Prince.
Was Voldemort considering having a child before then? If he
wasn't, then perhaps the destruction of the prophesy convinced him
to move forward with this alternative plan to protect Slytherin’s
legacy. Delphi must have been born before the trio were abducted
and taken to Malfoy Manor, since Bellatrix showed no obvious signs
of having been pregnant when she appeared in that sequence.
13 WHY WAS AMOS DIGGORY SINGLED OUT?


Delphi evidently decided that she needed a cover story while she
developed her plan to bring her father back. She posed as a niece
of Amos Diggory and bewitched Amos with a Confundus charm so that
he would go along with her deception.
In Cursed Child, Amos seeks out Harry Potter and begs him to use
a Time-Turner to save his son Cedric’s life. However, how did
Delphi know that “the spare” in the prophesy referred to Cedric
in the first place? She needed some way of getting the Time-Turner
herself, but how did she know Albus and Scorpius would be eager to
help? Did she know all along that humiliating Credirc would create
a timeline where Voldemort won, or did she only realize that
possibility after Albus and Scorpius told her about it?
12 WHY WEREN'T THE ROWLES MORE SUPPORTIVE OF HER?


Voldemort obviously expected to win the Second Wizarding War and
for his influence to grow. This would have made it much safer for
Delphi to grow up in a world where Voldemort was in charge and his
followers controlled the Wizarding World. Regardless, the Rowle
family was known to be pretty devoted Death Eaters. If they
believed in Voldemort’s cause, wouldn’t they have been happy to
help raise Voldemort’s daughter?
Delphi tells Scorpius and Albus that Euphemia Rowle took her in
mostly for the gold that was offered to her. Like most Death Eaters
after Voldemort was defeated, Euphemia probably didn’t want
anything to do with Voldemort or his daughter. However, it seems
odd that the Rowles would turn on Voldemort and still agree to
raise his child.
11 WERE HER MAGICAL TALENTS INHERITED OR LEARNED?


It seems pretty random how magical talent may manifest in young
witches and wizards. Both nature and nurture can play a big part.
Harry’s parents were both very talented in magic,  but Harry
grew up with the Dursleys, who discouraged even mentioning magic.
Similarly, Delphi grew up in an unsupportive home. She at least
knew about magic, but she didn’t know about her true potential as
Voldemort’s heir until Rodolphus found her. Again, this is
similar to Harry, since Hagrid was the one who found him and told
him about his parents.
Did Delphi study and practice on her own to develop her magical
power? Also, did it only begin in earnest after Rodolphus found her
and assisted her, or was she always a natural talent like her
father was before her?
10 HOW CAN SHE CLAIM TO KNOW HARRY BETTER THAN VOLDEMORT DID?


In the confrontation between Harry and Delphi in the past,
Delphi claims to know Harry better than Voldemort ever did. At
best, this could only be a taunt to throw Harry off even more. It
seems very unlikely that the claim can actually be true.
Voldemort and Harry shared a multifaceted magical link. Harry
became an unintentional Horcrux when Voldemort attacked him as an
infant, and, later, Voldemort used Harry’s blood to restore his
corporeal body. Over the course of their confrontations, Voldemort
also successfully tricked Harry into thinking Sirius was held
captive in the Department of Mysteries. Delphi never had access to
Harry Potter like that. The only way that boast would carry weight
is if Delphi had supposedly learned from her father’s mistakes in
fighting Harry.
9 HOW DID SHE SNEAK INTO HOGWARTS IN THE FIRST ALTERNATE TIMELINE?


When Albus and Scorpius traveled back in time the first time,
they didn’t reshape events like they wanted. They didn’t save
Cedric’s life and their own lives and families were altered in
disappointing ways. Ron and Hermione never married or had children,
and Albus was sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin,
separating Albus and Scorpius.
Albus sends Delphi an owl letting her know that they failed and
Delphi sneaks into Hogwarts to convince Scorpius and Albus to
reconcile. However, i's never explained how this is
possible. What's even more confusing is the fact
that Delphi even remarks on how lax Hogwarts' security
seems. However, she never actually tells Albus exactly how she got
into the school without getting caught.
8 WHY WOULD SHE PREFER PASSING AWAY OR AMNESIA?


When Delphi, Albus, Scorpius, and Harry and his adult friends
travel back in time to October 1981, they stop Delphi from changing
the future. She had planned to prevent Voldemort from encountering
Harry as a baby, thereby ensuring that he would never be defeated
in the first place. All of her deceptive and malicious efforts were
meant to reunite her with her father.
When Albus, Scorpius, and their families defeat her, she begs
them to take her life or at least wipe her memory of her family
and her identity. However, it's unclear why she would wish this.
Was her relationship with her absent father so important to her
that this failure was intolerable for her? If she were imprisoned,
there would at least  still be the possibility of escaping and
continuing to serve his legacy.
7 IS SHE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN?


Plenty of Voldemort's followers were sentenced to terms in
Azkaban. Even some wizards and witches who were wrongly convicted
of crimes connected to Lord Voldemort’s service endured
incarceration in the prison.
Sirius Black managed to escapd Azkaban on his own, without any
outside help. His conviction in his innocence let him fool the
Dementors and slip away. The only time other genuine followers of
Voldemort escaped from Azkaban was when the Dementors deserted
their posts and joined him. After 1998, the Ministry of Magic
stopped employing Dementors as guards. So when Delphi was
imprisoned, Aurors would stand guard instead. Even with the
Dementors gone, the magical safeguards against escaping prisoners
must be considerable. Voldemort never had to escape from Azkaban,
so we don’t know if Voldemort’s daughter is capable of doing it
or not.
6 WHY DOES SHE HAVE A TATTOO OF HER AUGUREY?


Delphi was sent to live with Euphemia Rowle, who became her
foster mother. Rowle kept an Augurey as a pet. The Augurey is a
magical bird that supposedly wails whenever a passerby should be
wary of an unfortunate fate, though the more informed consensus on
the creature claims that Augureys wail when rain is imminent.
Either way, it doesn’t make much sense as to why Delphi would
get an Augurey tattoo. This bird was a reminder of her childhood
guardian and how much she disliked Delphini. Perhaps instead of
being an omen of downfall, Delphi fashioned it into a symbol of her
authority. The Augurey was her alias in the timeline where
Voldemort won the war, but it's never explained why.
5 DID VOLDEMORT PLAN ON HAVING ANY OTHER HEIRS?
Historical, real life royal families always made sure to produce
multiple children when possible. Multiple children was the best way
to increase the chances of the family enduring. As much as
Voldemort’s pure-blood mania ties in with tradition, it’s
likely Voldemort considered siring multiple heirs. He made multiple
Horcruxes as part of that plan to achieve immortality, so why not
produce multiple children to continue Slytherin’s bloodline as
well?
Perhaps Voldemort would have produced multiple heirs in the
timeline in which he won the war, but we don’t learn anything
definitive to that end. Voldemort might have imagined that multiple
heirs would compete with and threaten to destroy each other, or
him.
4 DOES SHE HAVE ANY HALF SIBLINGS?


As far as we know, Voldemort never had any other children of his
own. However, Bellatrix, the mother of Delphini, was also married.
Rodolphus Lestrange and Bellatrix Black were married shortly after
they both graduated from Hogwarts.
Rodolphus and Bellatrix were among the only Death Eaters to stay
faithful to Voldemort after the infant Harry Potter defeated him.
They may have shared a passion for pure-blood ideology and serving
Voldemort, but there is nothing to indicate any passion or romantic
interest between them. Their two families arranged their marriage,
so it seems like their sense of duty never compelled them to
produce legitimate children. However, this is never confirmed.
3 HOW DID RODOLPHUS TELL HER ABOUT HER HERITAGE?


Rodolphus survived the Battle of Hogwarts, unlike his wife and
his master. The reformed Ministry of Magic sentenced Rodolphus to
imprisonment in Azkaban again for his crimes. We'd expect the
Ministry to ensure that Rodolphus never escaped again, especially
since he was originally sentenced to life in prison for using the
Cruciatus curse on the Longbottoms.
Whether he escaped again or if he was in fact released is not
certain. If he had actually escaped again, you might expect the
Ministry to lead a manhunt for him, like they did with Sirius
Black. However, somehow Rodolphus managed to find the natural
daughter of his wife Bellatrix and Lord Voldemort, since Delphi
learned the truth of her heritage from Rodolphus.
2 DID SHE EVER ASPIRE TO BECOME A DARK RULER HERSELF?


Above all else, Delphi wanted to meet her father. She wanted to
be with him and prove herself to him. However, what did she
imagine for the two of them after that? If she succeeded in
changing history so that they could be together, would their
relationship still turn out like she imagined?
If Harry Potter never became destined to defeat Voldemort, would
Voldemort still eventually win the Wizarding War? Would Delphi have
still grown into her father’s right hand agent? Would she have
been happy in that role forever? Could their relationship have
grown any deeper or healthier than Voldemort’s relationship with
his other servants? Would Delphi only consider becoming a dark
ruler in her own right if her father was defeated, or would she
ever consider overthrowing him?
1 HOW DID SHE BECOME SO CHARMING?


Delphi used magic to trick Amos Diggory into believing she was
his niece. However, other than that, she played a pretty
convincing part. Harry, Albus, and Scorpius all trusted Delphi
immediately. Delphi endeared herself to both Albus and Scorpius
with just the right amount of shyness and righteousness.
However, how did she learn to be so good at manipulating
people? Voldemort had a lot of practice putting on faces to
manipulate people at his orphanage, at Hogwarts, and in the wider
Wizarding World. Delphi never had that experience. She presumably
stayed cooped up with Euphemia Rowle until Rodolphus found her. Did
she simply inherit her nefarious people skills from her father?

foster mother. Rowle kept an Augurey as a pet. The Augurey is a
magical bird that supposedly wails whenever a passerby should be
wary of an unfortunate fate, though the more informed consensus on
the creature claims that Augureys wail when rain is imminent.
Either way, it doesn’t make much sense as to why Delphi would
get an Augurey tattoo. This bird was a reminder of her childhood
guardian and how much she disliked Delphini. Perhaps instead of
being an omen of downfall, Delphi fashioned it into a symbol of her
authority. The Augurey was her alias in the timeline where
Voldemort won the war, but it's never explained why.
5 DID VOLDEMORT PLAN ON HAVING ANY OTHER HEIRS?
Historical, real life royal families always made sure to produce
multiple children when possible. Multiple children was the best way
to increase the chances of the family enduring. As much as
Voldemort’s pure-blood mania ties in with tradition, it’s
likely Voldemort considered siring multiple heirs. He made multiple
Horcruxes as part of that plan to achieve immortality, so why not
produce multiple children to continue Slytherin’s bloodline as
well?
Perhaps Voldemort would have produced multiple heirs in the
timeline in which he won the war, but we don’t learn anything
definitive to that end. Voldemort might have imagined that multiple
heirs would compete with and threaten to destroy each other, or
him.
4 DOES SHE HAVE ANY HALF SIBLINGS?


As far as we know, Voldemort never had any other children of his
own. However, Bellatrix, the mother of Delphini, was also married.
Rodolphus Lestrange and Bellatrix Black were married shortly after
they both graduated from Hogwarts.
Rodolphus and Bellatrix were among the only Death Eaters to stay
faithful to Voldemort after the infant Harry Potter defeated him.
They may have shared a passion for pure-blood ideology and serving
Voldemort, but there is nothing to indicate any passion or romantic
interest between them. Their two families arranged their marriage,
so it seems like their sense of duty never compelled them to
produce legitimate children. However, this is never confirmed.
3 HOW DID RODOLPHUS TELL HER ABOUT HER HERITAGE?


Rodolphus survived the Battle of Hogwarts, unlike his wife and
his master. The reformed Ministry of Magic sentenced Rodolphus to
imprisonment in Azkaban again for his crimes. We'd expect the
Ministry to ensure that Rodolphus never escaped again, especially
since he was originally sentenced to life in prison for using the
Cruciatus curse on the Longbottoms.
Whether he escaped again or if he was in fact released is not
certain. If he had actually escaped again, you might expect the
Ministry to lead a manhunt for him, like they did with Sirius
Black. However, somehow Rodolphus managed to find the natural
daughter of his wife Bellatrix and Lord Voldemort, since Delphi
learned the truth of her heritage from Rodolphus.
2 DID SHE EVER ASPIRE TO BECOME A DARK RULER HERSELF?


Above all else, Delphi wanted to meet her father. She wanted to
be with him and prove herself to him. However, what did she
imagine for the two of them after that? If she succeeded in
changing history so that they could be together, would their
relationship still turn out like she imagined?
If Harry Potter never became destined to defeat Voldemort, would
Voldemort still eventually win the Wizarding War? Would Delphi have
still grown into her father’s right hand agent? Would she have
been happy in that role forever? Could their relationship have
grown any deeper or healthier than Voldemort’s relationship with
his other servants? Would Delphi only consider becoming a dark
ruler in her own right if her father was defeated, or would she
ever consider overthrowing him?
1 HOW DID SHE BECOME SO CHARMING?


Delphi used magic to trick Amos Diggory into believing she was
his niece. However, other than that, she played a pretty
convincing part. Harry, Albus, and Scorpius all trusted Delphi
immediately. Delphi endeared herself to both Albus and Scorpius
with just the right amount of shyness and righteousness.
However, how did she learn to be so good at manipulating
people? Voldemort had a lot of practice putting on faces to
manipulate people at his orphanage, at Hogwarts, and in the wider
Wizarding World. Delphi never had that experience. She presumably
stayed cooped up with Euphemia Rowle until Rodolphus found her. Did
she simply inherit her nefarious people skills from her father?

Potter that make no sense? Let us know in the
